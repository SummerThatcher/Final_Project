        <p><span>Hi, I'm Summer Thatcher and I'm just a self-proclaimed nerd who enjoys video games, outdoor activities like kayaking 
            and ATVs, traveling and over the past couple years DIY projects.  Like everyone else 
            in quarantine I decided I needed to pick up more hobbies, for some it was gardening
            or baking but for me it was DIY projects.  If you'd like you can check out a
            few of the <a href="DIYprojects.html">projects</a>. On February 6th 2022 I will
            have been with Ford Credit for 15 years. In that time I went from an entry level
            representative to an expert in my field of work, so much so that I've been trusted to
            head the training for my entire department for representatives and supervisors alike.</span></p>

        <p><span>I want to be a software engineer because I enjoy problem solving and creating 
        things like in my DIY projects. I have an eye for detail and utilizing that 
        skill in a new way is an exciting notion. I love being able to work remotely
        from anywhere while also collaborating with a team and potentially do something
        that will impact a large number of people. The first time I ever played around with
        HTML and CSS I was 12 and I can remeber feeling so cool that with just a few strokes
        on the keyboard I could turn something drab and boring into something fun that
        represented me and my personality.</span></p>
