      <h2>Revisions</h2>
      <p class="introduction">After requesting some feedback on my site from 
                co-workers and family these are the revisions that I made based on
                that feedback. Below you will see the before image of the site on 
                the left and after image on the right with the details of the suggestions
                I received between each image.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>
          <div class="revisions">
	    <img src="images/revision1.PNG" alt="before revision">
            <p class="">The first revisions I made were to the homepage, a co-worker made 
               note that the main header looked bulky and the background color of 
               the "about me" and paragraphs of the home page took up the length of 
               the page.  So I made the header more compact and adjusted the background 
               color to only span the length of the word and not across the entire page.</p>
        <img src="images/revision2.PNG" alt="after revision">
          </div>
        </li>
        <br><br>
        <li>
            <div class="revisions">
          <img src="images/revision3.PNG" alt="before revision">
              <p>The next revision I made was to the project page. The feedback I received was
                 that all the extra space around the images made the site look clunky. I realigned
                 the table to reduce that excess space and increased the size of the table header
                 to make it more readable.</p>

          <img src="images/revision4.PNG" alt="before revision">
              <p>The last revision I made was also to the project page. It was suggested that 
                I include more details about the projects, whether it be why I chose these projects
                or how I went about completeing them.
