                 <td>I was in the market for some additional storage that would double as a focal piece and as I was shopping around, I was drawn to the look of the apothecary cabinets but not to the price of them.  For the size of the cabinet that I was looking for the price tag was anywhere from $4,500 to $19,000. So, I started looking for alternatives and came across this video about making your own apothecary cabinet out of 2 unfinished dressers from IKEA and that's what started it all.  It took me approximately 2 months of working on this in my free time to sand, condition, stain, seal and install the hardware and all the hard work paid off, it definitely became a focal point in my home.</td>

                 <td>When my husband and I purchased this house it had a pea green door that had cracks down the center and didn't seal properly.  It was one of the first things I was adamant about replacing. So again, I started doing some research to determine a color scheme that complimented red brick homes and as I was searching, I loved the look of a dark door against the red brick.  So, I measured the door and frame and went shopping.  After picking the door style I chose a beautiful shade of black.  I primed and painted the door and the following day we demoed and replaced the frame and door. We will also be sanding and painting the shutters using the same color but that's a project for another time.</td>

                 <td>I grew up with lots of animals: chicken, geese, rabbits, pigs, and horses just to name a few and always aspired to have farm animals as an adult.  When my husband and I were searching for a home to buy one of the must haves for me was land to keep those animals. Now that that’s happened getting chickens just seems like the natural next step.  If you haven’t figured this out already, I’m a researcher at heart and I always say that Google is my friend. After hours of research, I decided a mobile coop was the best option for us. And again, the price tag on a pre-built mobile coop was way more than I was comfortable with.  Due to the lumber shortage, we haven’t started the build yet but hopefully soon…</td>
