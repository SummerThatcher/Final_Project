        <p><span>Hi, I'm Summer, I'm just a <i>*sings* 35 year old lady...</i> who 
            enjoys video games, outdoor activities like kayaking and ATVs, travel and
            over the past 2 years DIY projects.  Like everyone else in quarantine I 
            decided I needed to pick up more hobbies, for some it was gardening or 
            baking but for me it was DIY projects.  If you'd like you can check out a
            few of the <a href="DIYprojects.html">projects</a>.

        I want to be a software engineer because I enjoy problem solving and creating 
        things like in my DIY projects. I have an eye for detail and utilizing that 
        skill in a new way is an exciting notion. I love being able to work remotely
        from anywhere while also collaborating with a team and potentially do something
        that will impact a large number of people.
